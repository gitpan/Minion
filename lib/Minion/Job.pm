=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Minion::Job;

  my $job = Minion::Job->new(id => $oid, minion => $minion, task => 'foo');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Minion::Job> is a container for L<Minion> jobs.

=head1 EVENTS

  $job->on(failed => sub {
    my ($job, $err) = @_;
    say "Something went wrong: $err";
  });

=head2 finished

  $job->on(finished => sub {
    my $job = shift;
    ...
  });

Emitted after this job transitioned to the C<finished> state.

  $job->on(finished => sub {
    my $job = shift;
    my $oid = $job->id;
    say "Job $oid is finished.";
  });
